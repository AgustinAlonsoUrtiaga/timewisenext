            I see you&apos;re checking out my pageâ€”how exciting! Let me quickly introduce myself. 
            I&apos;m a systems engineering student who started out as a junior developer at a startup in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
            There, I worked with <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, and <strong>Angular</strong>, 
            all within the <strong>Redux</strong> ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
            Currently, I&apos;m working for <strong>Ignitix</strong>, a company based in Vienna, Austria, while living in Germany. 
            In my current role, I primarily use <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>. 
            I&apos;m well-versed in <strong>Scrum</strong> practices, including daily standups, planning, and retrospectives. 
            I&apos;ve also gained experience creating <strong>Dockerfiles</strong>, managing code with <strong>Git</strong>, 
            and maintaining comprehensive documentation.
